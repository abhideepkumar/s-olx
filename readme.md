# S-OLX

## Project Overview
The **S-OLX** is a web-based application tailored specifically for college students to buy, sell, and exchange stuff with the college communities. Inspired by platforms like OLX but designed to cater to student needs, it ensures a secure and convenient experience by verifying users through their college email addresses. Students can list items for sale such as stationery, furniture, bikes, and more. Additionally, the platform features a community page for discussions and product reviews.

## Key Features
- **Marketplace for Products**: Create and browse listings for items like textbooks, furniture, electronics, vehicles etc.
- **College Email Verification**: All users are verified through their academic email to ensure security and genuineness of the user.
- **Community Page**: Engage with peers through a text-based feed for posts, reviews, referrrals, alumni-talks and more.

- **Product Review System**: Leave comments and feedback on items.

Come on man, we are not targetting you, we are just helping you.
